# MovieRAG

## Overview

MovieRAG is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation application that uses an external movie data source (IMDb) to provide context-aware
responses to movie recommendation requests. It combines a ChromaDB based retriever with an OpenAI generator. The retriever
fetches relevant vector-embedded movie data (based on user prompt) and provides it to the generator with the original 
userâ€™s query. The generator uses this additional context to generate an accurate and relevant response.

## Installation

```

```
