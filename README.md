# MovieRAG

## Overview

MovieRAG is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation application that uses an external movie data source (IMDb) to provide context-aware
responses to movie recommendation requests. It combines a ChromaDB based retriever with an OpenAI generator. The retriever
fetches relevant vector-embedded movie data (based on user prompt) and provides it to the generator with the original 
userâ€™s query. The generator uses this additional context to generate an accurate and relevant response.

Update: This application now also supports CAG capabilities on a smaller dataset.

## Installation

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

## Usage

### Curate Dataset (Optional)
Raw IMDb structured data has already been curated for word embedding based RAG usage. This curated data has been stored 
as `data/curated/movie_curated.csv`. This step can be skipped if the existing curated data is satisfactory.
#### 1. Download Raw Data
Download the following four [IMDb Non-Commercial Datasets](https://datasets.imdbws.com/) and move them to the `data/raw`
directory:
1. `name.basics.tsv`
2. `title.basics.tsv`
3. `title.principals.tsv`
4. `title.ratings.tsv`

#### 2. Execute Data Curator
The data curator will use the .tsv data in `data/raw` to create a curated .csv movie data set in `data/curated`, 
formatted and structured to allow for useful word embeddings. With default settings, this application takes approximately
2 minutes to run to completion on my computer.
```
python data_curator.py [-h] [-r RATING] [-v VOTE] [-c]
```
* -h, --help: Show the help message and exit.
* -r RATING, --rating RATING: Minimum rating required for a movie to be included in the curated dataset.
Type: float | Default: 7.0 
* -v VOTE, --vote VOTE: Minimum number of votes required for a movie to qualify.
Type: int | Default: 1000
* -c, --cag: Store curated data in the `data/curated/cag` folder (as opposed to the default `data/curated/rag` folder)

### Export OpenAI API key

To authenticate your API reference with OpenAI, [create an API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and [set 
environment variable](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5112595-best-practices-for-api-key-safety) `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

### Running MovieRAG

To execute the MovieRAG application, run:

```
python chroma_rag.py [-h] [-v] [-k K]
```
* -h, --help: Show help message and exit.
* -v, --verbose: Enable verbose mode to print results from the query similarity search.
* -k K: Specify the number of documents to return from the query similarity search (default: 3).

### Running MovieCAG

To execute the MovieCAG application, run:

```
python cag.py [-h] [-v]
```
* -h, --help: Show help message and exit.
* -v, --verbose: Enable verbose mode to print the entire input fed into the chat model.

## Features
* #### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
    Combines ChromaDB-based document retrieval with OpenAI's GPT to generate context-aware movie recommendations.
* #### Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG)
    Provides a cache memory to OpenAI's GPT to generate context-aware movie recommendations.
* #### Context-Enriched Responses
    Enhances natural language queries using semantically relevant data pulled from a curated IMDb dataset.
* #### Custom Curated Dataset
    Includes a script to process raw IMDb .tsv data into a clean .csv format optimized for word embeddings and vector search.
* ##### Flexible Query Parameters
    Easily configure the number of context documents returned with -k, or enable debug mode with -d for insight into retrieval results.
* #### Modular Design for Experimentation
    Clean separation between data curation, retrieval, and generation logic for easier experimentation and extension.
